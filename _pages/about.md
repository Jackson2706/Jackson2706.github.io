Greetings! I’m currently a Research Assistant at the College of Engineering and Computer Science, VinUniversity, where I have the privilege of working on Multi-modal Learning and Trustworthy AI under the mentorship of <a href="https://www.tcd.ie/scss/people/academic-staff/nguyenva/">Assist. Prof. Nguyen Van Dinh</a> and <a href="https://vinuni.edu.vn/vi/people/pho-giao-su-kok-seng-wong/">Assoc. Prof. Kok-Seng Wong</a>. Previously, I gained industry experience optimizing AI for resource-constrained hardware as an AI Engineer at Viettel High Tech.

Prior to that, I received my B.Eng. degree in Electronics and Telecommunications from Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST) in 2025. I graduated with an "Excellent" classification (CPA 3.6/4.0), where my strong foundation in Signal Processing sparked my transition into Machine Learning research.

My recent research focuses on bridging the gap between theoretical efficiency and real-world deployment. My work spans Computer Vision (video understanding, image restoration), Multi-modal Learning (WiFi-based sensing), and Trustworthy AI (Federated Learning, privacy preservation). I am particularly interested in how we can make deep learning models not only more accurate but also more data-efficient and robust in decentralized environments.

I’m actively seeking Ph.D. opportunities in Computer Science/Machine Learning, with a strong interest in the research areas mentioned above.
